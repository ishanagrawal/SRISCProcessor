There are two subdirectories:

/Easy:
    A sample test case described in the specification. There are two
answers given:
    result.disambiguator: A possible sample result.
    result.best.disambiguator: The best possible result.

As long as your answer doesnt contradict the best possible output 
(i.e. YES -> NO,  or NO -> YES), then it is acceptable. As
mentioned in the specification, "MAYBE" is always correct :).

/Turing:
    Place your own assembly program and configuration file here to 
highlights the ability of your disambiguator. Note that "complicated" 
means the relationship between the two memory access instruction, 
not the complexity of the overall assembly program.
